# **First project**

## **Description**
This is a project about modern and effective teaching approaches.
The project uses technologies such as:
* To create meshes are used flex and grid-layot
* Sometimes is used position
* The project uses BEM technology: classes and file structure(nested)
* Sometimes is used mnemonics
* Also it includes animations, frames, keyframes

## **Plans**
Also i have plans to improve project. I will add:
* Other fonts
* I will add all vendor prefixes
* And maybe I'll make a form with which users can post comments
